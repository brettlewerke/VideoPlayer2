Hoser Video - Version 3.0.1 Update Notes
========================================

This update includes several important changes and new features:

• Deleting old database (.hoser-video) files when reinstalling
  When you reinstall the program, it automatically deletes all .hoser-video folders from multiple drives

• Full screen video playback with auto-hiding controls
  The player now goes full screen with a 3 second delay from input - meaning the UI controls automatically 
  hide after 3 seconds of no mouse movement

• Everytime you reinstall the program it wipes all video progress data (timestamps)
  Due to the automatic cleanup of .hoser-video folders, all your viewing progress is reset on each reinstall

• You can move the window around and it's not fixed
  The application window is now freely moveable and not locked to a specific position

• Webscraping from Rotten Tomatoes has been moved to OMDB API
  This runs in the background and no longer runs before the application runs. This is used for the poster 
  pictures. This is a free API with 1000 requests per month. If no WiFi connection is detected it will 
  silently fail and not display a poster. However, the .jpg images are stored in the .hoser-video folder 
  at the root of each folder respective to which drive has movies. So if you are hard on space, you can 
  remove these images (if you're offline). Each poster .jpg is in the respective movie name folder.
